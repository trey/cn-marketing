        <p>I just wanted to send a quick note to mention that I’ve changed payment processors from Stripe to Paddle. This was the result of learning of the importance of collecting sales tax!</p>
        <p>If you want to read more about this change, check out <a href="/changelog/2021-03-04/">the Changelog</a>.</p>
        <p>As a reward for being a subscriber of this email, I’ve decided to use a neat little feature of Paddle: being able to create fun, one-off coupon codes!</p>
        <p>The first 10 people to use the code <b>NEWSLETTER-FRIENDS</b> will get 25% off their first payment.</p>
        <p>Thanks,<br />Trey</p>
