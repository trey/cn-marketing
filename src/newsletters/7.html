        <p>I hope everybody is staying safe (and masking up whenever you leave home).</p>
        <p>This is to let you know that you can now (financially) support this project by getting a paid subscription!</p>
        <p><a href="https://app.cassettenest.com/settings/#subscription">You can subscribe and manage your subscription from your settings page.</a></p>
        <p>For this first pass, I’m not limiting functionality if you choose not to pay—you’ll just see a banner at the top of the page. Eventually, subscriptions will be required. I’ll fill you in on more details when we get to that point.</p>
        <p>The prices are currently set at <b>$2 per month</b> or <b>$20 per year</b>. I want this to be inexpensive enough that you won’t hesitate to give it a try. After all, a whole year costs about the same as getting a single roll of film developed and scanned at a good lab.</p>
        <p>I know it still has a ways to go, but I’m really excited to get back to building new features and improving existing ones rather than writing legal documents and payment integrations! Cassette Nest has been my full-time gig for the past few months, so I’m also really excited at the possibility of earning a little money from the endeavor. 😄</p>
        <p>Until next time,<br />
        Trey</p>
