        <p>I just wanted to send a quick update to tell you about a couple of fun things in the world of your favorite analog photography tracking software.</p>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Cassette Nest was featured on the excellent YouTube show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T631NZaXqeY&amp;t=190s&amp;utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new-feature-add-your-own-film-stocks" target="_blank">Nico’s Photo News</a>! He gave a fairly detailed overview of the app and why you might want to use it. </p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> Because of the first item, there was an influx of new folks signing up (Hello, new folks!) who immediately let me know of a need for more film stocks. I figured out what seems like a pretty nice way of letting anyone add their own new films. Try it out if you have the need and <a href="https://cassettenest.com/feedback/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new-feature-add-your-own-film-stocks" target="_blank">let me know</a> how it goes!</p>

        <p>I would not have realized how urgently this was needed without these new folks, so <a href="https://treypiepmeier.com/words/2019/07/cassette-nest-update-4-early-users/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new-feature-add-your-own-film-stocks" target="_blank">I’m very grateful</a>!</p>
        <p>I’m going to steal this excellent sign-off message from another indie developer in the film photography world, <a href="http://midtonemachines.com/news/a-lick-of-paint/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new-feature-add-your-own-film-stocks" target="_blank">Midtone Machines</a>:</p>
        <p>“I read and reply to everything and really value suggestions and feedback!”</p>
        <p>It’s true!</p>
        <p>Until next time,<br />
        Trey</p>
