        <p>As <a href="https://cassettenest.com/newsletters/3/">I hinted at before</a>, I’ve been working on <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/trey-labs?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">T-shirts</a>, and now they’re ready!</p>
        <p><a href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/trey-labs?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank"><img alt="Shirt" src="/img/newsletters/c762f489-4c15-4b76-b22d-14eceda0773b.png"></a></p>
        <p>My goal with these was to make something that would appeal to folks even if they had no interest in Cassette Nest. There are a variety of colors and styles to choose from.</p>
        <p><a href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/trey-labs?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank"><img alt="shirt options" src="/img/newsletters/bbc9adac-8ed5-466f-806d-a5e705c036c3.png"></a></p>
        <p>Until the app is accepting payments, this is a great way to <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/trey-labs?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">show your support</a> of what I’m building and get an awesome shirt as well. They’re also a great gift idea for the holidays. :)</p>

        <p>The illustration was done by the incredibly talented <a href="https://jeanwei.com?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">Jean Wei</a>. If you’re not familiar with her work, you are in for a treat. I particularly recommend checking out <a href="https://jeanwei.com/sequential?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available#/heat/" target="_blank">Heat</a>. It’s available digitally <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/heatpeow?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">here</a>, but I recommend getting a physical copy if you can find it. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>That’s the main news, but here’s a little update on the app itself:</p>
        <p><img alt="CSV files in macOS’s Finder" src="/img/newsletters/b859b1ec-7c25-4f16-b43d-1c7559d3ed19.png"> </p>
        <p>I’m working on data export and import! This is the last bit of functionality I want to get in place before considering the app to be out of “beta.” I know that having control of my own data is incredibly valuable and I expect it’s important to all of you as well. Even if Cassette Nest disappears one day, you’ll still have your glorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">CSV</a>s to import somewhere else or just open in Lotus 1-2-3. My goal is to have the export be as human readable as possible while still being able to restore all your data in the app.</p>
        <p>That’s all for today. As always, I love getting feedback, so have at it! </p>
        <p>Stay safe out there and <a href="https://text.npr.org/933903848?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cassette-nest-t-shirts-are-now-available" target="_blank">please wear a mask</a>. </p>
        <p>Later,<br>
        Trey</p>
