        <p>Happy end of the year! I hope everybody is safe and well. Please wear a mask whenever you leave home and get a COVID-19 vaccine whenever it’s available to you. Pretty please!</p>
        <h2>Since <a href="https://cassettenest.com/newsletters/5/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=december-update-2020-recap" target="_blank">last we spoke</a> …</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We now have a <a href="https://cassettenest.com/changelog/2020-12-14/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=december-update-2020-recap" target="_blank">public changelog</a>. If you want to stay up to date beyond what’s in these emails, that’s a good place to look. There’s even an RSS feed if that’s your thing.</li>
            <li>You can now <a href="https://cassettenest.com/changelog/2020-12-17/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=december-update-2020-recap" target="_blank">export all your own data</a>! Importing those exports needs streamlining before being released to the public, but we’ll get there.</li>

        <h2>Other stuff that happened this year.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can <strong>add your own film and film manufacturers</strong>. You can use them right away but they can potentially be adjusted and made available to everybody. Thanks for helping out!</li>
            <li>You can create cameras that allow for <strong>multiple camera backs</strong>. This allows for a little bonus of being able to load 35mm film in a medium format camera (if you define your camera back that way).</li>

Glad to have you!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s all for today. As always, I appreciate every one of you and I love <a href="https://cassettenest.com/feedback/?utm_source=cassettenest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=december-update-2020-recap" target="_blank">getting feedback</a>, so have at it!</p>
        <p>Later,<br/>
