title: Terms of Service
description: All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Trey Labs product.
---

From everyone at [Trey Labs](https://treylabs.com) (right now, that‚Äôs just me, [Trey](https://treypiepmeier.com) üëãüèª), thank you for using our products! We build them to help you get the most out of your film photography. Because we don‚Äôt know every one of our users personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

When we say ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù in this document, we are referring to Trey Labs LLC.

When we say ‚ÄúServices‚Äù, we mean any product created and maintained by Trey Labs LLC.

When we say ‚ÄúYou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made since January 2021 [on GitHub](https://github.com/trey/cn-marketing/[link-tba]).  Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on [our changelog](https://cassettenest.com/changelog/).

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That‚Äôs true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. **These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That‚Äôs a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are](https://treylabs.com), [how we work](https://treypiepmeier.com/words/tag/cassettenest/), and keeping an open door to [your feedback][feedback].

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
2. You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use Restrictions policy](/policy/abuse/).
3. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.
4. You must be a human. Accounts registered by ‚Äúbots‚Äù or other automated methods are not permitted.

## Payment

1. Billing is managed through [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and all plan management is done on their website via [the Subscription section of your settings page](https://app.cassettenest.com/settings/#subscription).
2. _**Currently, a paid plan is only a way of supporting ongoing development of Cassette Nest--there is no limitation of the functionality of the application.** In the future, plan to offer a free trial period and then put your account in **read-only** if you don‚Äôt subscribe (or your subscription lapses or is canceled)._

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your subscription. You can cancel your subscription at any time via [the Subscription section of your settings page](https://app.cassettenest.com/settings/#subscription). If you need help cancelling your subscription, you can always [contact us][feedback]
2. After cancellation, there is _currently no change in the functionality of the application_, but in the future, it will put your account into a **read-only** mode.
3. After you've requested your subscription to be canceled, your subscription will still be fully active until your current billing period ends. If you'd like to cancel it immediately, [let us know][feedback], and we'll manually cancel it immediately.
4. Currently, there is no self-service way of entirely canceling and deleting your account except by [contacting us][feedback]. We plan to offer that as a self-service option in the future.
5. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because eventually we're going to find someone doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. _We will not resort to this lightly. Just be cool, and we'll be cool._ For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](/policies/abuse/).
6. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of **anyone** will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. We have a goal of you being able to keep information you create our Service for perpetuity. [Your exports](https://app.cassettenest.com/settings/#export) are designed for portability and longevity. We will strive to keep this Service running for the foreseeable future. However, sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
2. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.
