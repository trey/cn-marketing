title: JavaScript enhancements for bulk updating rolls.

Now it's a little nicer to update a bunch of rolls, either from [the `/ready` page](https://app.cassettenest.com/ready/) or any logbook page where you can do a bulk update (not `storage` or `loaded`). There's now a checkbox on the top left of any of those tables where you can select all the (visible) rolls. If there are enough rolls that they're paginated (over 20), you can't update them all at once. The update button now tells you how many rolls you're about to update.

If you don't have JavaScript enabled (or it fails), you'll get the same form, just without the fancy updating button text or the select-all checkbox.

We're also no longer redirecting to the old Dashboard page (which was terrible) when you update rolls from the `/ready` page.
