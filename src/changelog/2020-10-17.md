After getting an influx of new users, a resounding request kept coming in: folks had lots of different film stocks they wanted to use that weren't already in the system. I hadn't anticipated that being such an urgent request since I built the system with lots of film stocks available right away. I didn't know how many folks wanted to use more unusual or expired films. I came up with what I think is a pretty sweet solution of letting folks add whatever they want, but those additions only show up for that user until I can verify that it meets the quality standard I want to maintain for the shared data in the system. I didn't just want a free-for-all. I think this solution benefits everyone. The user gets to do whatever they want right away, and it won't make a mess for everyone else. Plus, I don't have to do all that data entry myself! :)
