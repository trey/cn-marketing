We now have official policy documents! Exciting, right? This is part of the work that needs to be done before we make paid subscriptions available. Exchanging money feels very official, so let’s make sure we all know what we’re in for.

[Here are the documents.](/policies/)

- [Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy/)
- [Terms of Service](/policies/terms/)
- [Use Restrictions](/policies/abuse/)

Thanks to [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for making [their policies](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) available for other folks to adapt. That would have required a _lot_ more work if I’d had to start from scratch!

## Infrastructure Improvements

Reading through and considering all the aspects of these documents led to some improvements to the overall infrastructure of the application. Things like deleting automated database backups that are older than 30 days, encrypting all the backups that aren't stored on the same server as the application itself, improving the size and integrity of those backups, and setting up a way to quickly verify production backups on a locally-running version of the application. Cool stuff!
