This is still hidden functionality with the current state of the app, but it was great to get this in place. It felt like a huge milestone. Most of the heavy lifting was done by [the dj-stripe library](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe).

I eventually want to set up some kind of subscription price differences for members of marginalized / underrepresented groups and maybe even location parity [as discussed here](https://gomakethings.com/conditional-cost-of-living-discounts-with-javascript-and-some-api-magic/).
