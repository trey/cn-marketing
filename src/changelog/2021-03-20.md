As a way of starting to make the process of journaling better, I’ve exposed some easy ways to write [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in every [`textarea`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea).

To be clear, these fields always supported Markdown, but there was no way of knowing unless you happened to try it.

I’ve borrowed [some functionality from GitHub](https://github.com/github/markdown-toolbar-element) (and [reinvented what they weren’t already sharing](https://gist.github.com/trey/2d733b55019a65ec685fc1f4a074e82c)) and this is what we’ve got…

Try it out and [let me know what you think](/feedback). More to come!
