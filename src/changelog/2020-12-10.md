title: Navigation Revamp
date: 2020-12-10

We've added an overall navigation change. There are now four main, top-level areas of the app. Almost everything sits in one of these areas.

{% include components/img
    name: 'changelog/top-navigation.png'
    width: 820
    height: 133
    alt: 'Top-level navigation'
%}

On the Logbook pages, there's now a redesigned status and year filter.

{% include components/img
    name: 'changelog/logbook-status-navigation.png'
    width: 852
    height: 236
    alt: 'Logbook navigation'
%}

Previously, the status filter was a dropdown menu you had to select and then submit. The year filter was always present even though it would negate any status selection, so now it only appears when you've selected the "All" filter, which shows all your film (that isn't in inventory--it's only film that's been started and therefore added to your Logbook).
