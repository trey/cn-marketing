Here it is: [tools.cassettenest.com/cropfactor/](https://tools.cassettenest.com/cropfactor/)

I started working on a more full-fledged version of [this CodePen experiment](https://codepen.io/trey/full/RjXrLY) (which [I once showed to the cinematographer of The Last Jedi](https://twitter.com/trey/status/977962019394605056)) a few months ago, but it’s been on the back burner until I was able to launch payment functionality. Now that [that’s ready](/changelog/2021-01-28/) (and some last remaining bugs are ironed out), it was time to revisit the crop factor calculator.

When I say "full-fledged," I mean that

1. I wanted it to work with or without JavaScript.
2. I wanted to have it so you could make adjustments and bookmark the resulting page to share or easily reference later.

I’m incredibly happy with how this turned out, because I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to figuring out how I want to build things on the web in (what I believe is) the “right way” using exactly the technology that I consider the best. The biggest piece of that is building things with progressive enhancement from the start. That means that 100% of the functionality of a thing is there without JavaScript: the server has all the smarts and the JavaScript is sprinkled on as an enhancement, not as base-level functionality.

Enjoy!
