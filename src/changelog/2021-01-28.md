You can now help financially support Cassette Nest by getting a paid subscription!

Just go to [your settings page](https://app.cassettenest.com/settings/#subscription) and choose a plan. To start with, there are two options:

- $2 per month
- $20 per year

This felt like a simple way to start it out and hopefully folks will feel like it's inexpensive enough to chip in a little towards ongoing development. Just so you know, it's just [me](https://treypiepmeier.com) working on this, and for the past few months, it's been my only gig. ðŸ˜…

For now, a subscription doesn't give you any extra functionality, it just removes a banner from the top of the page. Eventually, subscriptions will be required. I'll fill you in on more details when we get to that point.

Billing management is all through [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and is super secure. It's easy to change or cancel your subscription any time.
