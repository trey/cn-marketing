title: New “Card” Styles

A lot of the interface elements in Cassette Nest are grouped into the category of what I call a "card" in the code. That includes things like cameras on the homepage, lists of projects, rolls of film on the inventory page, and other things. You can [read more about the code behind them](https://treypiepmeier.com/words/2019/07/javascript-component-inspired-django-templates/) if you're so inclined.

When I went to make some screenshots for [the marketing site](/) the other day, I noticed that some of the little ["reminder tabs"](https://mltshp.com/p/1GXS4) on the homepage looked odd.

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/iso-80-before.png'
    alt: 'B&W ISO 80 reminder tab before'
    caption: 'ISO 80 reminder tab before&mdash;notice the 8 getting clipped on the left and both digits clipped on the top. This is apparently some quirk in this font at this particular size and weight.'
    width: 106 height: 99
%}

I ended up revamping the whole system, both CSS and HTML. The offending bit of interface now looks like this.

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/iso-80-after.png'
    alt: 'B&W ISO 80 reminder tab after'
    caption: 'More subtle and (hopefully) easier to read. Notice that we’re not just relying on the background color to indicate film type (B&W, C41, E6) now.'
    width: 104 height: 100
%}

Here's an example of all the available types before:

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/reminder-types-before.png'
    width: 98
    height: 301
    caption: 'All the reminder tab types before.'
    alt: 'An example of the old style reminder cards in every available type (BW, C41, E6).'
%}

Here's an example of all the available types now:

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/reminder-types.png'
    width: 102
    height: 301
    caption: 'All the reminder tab types now.'
    alt: 'An example of the new style reminder cards in every available type (BW, C41, E6).'
%}

These new colo(u)rs were borrowed from [the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/), specifically from [their tag component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/#additional-colours). This is yet another way [Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io) has inspired how I build the interface for Cassette Nest. Pretty much all my form elements are based on the [No Style Design System](http://nostyle.herokuapp.com).

Here's how film cards used to look.

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/film-cards-before.png'
    width: 957
    height: 331
    caption: 'Film cards have their type color over the entire card. So saturated!'
    alt: 'Film card styles before the latest change. The colors are obnoxiously saturated and there’s a “Web 2.0” gradient on them.'
%}

Here's how they look now.

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/film-cards.png'
    width: 957
    height: 331
    caption: 'Much more subtle and hopefully easier to read.'
    alt: 'Film inventory cards colored with their respective type colors.'
%}

Here's an example of hover styles for these new colors.

<figure>
    <img alt="Film inventory cards invert foreground and background colors on hover." src="/img/changelog/film-cards-hover.gif" width="385" height="357" />
<figcaption>Inverting foreground and background colors on hover.</figcaption>
</figure>

I hope folks like the new styles better than the old ones!
