This is a feature that required quite a bit of re-thinking of the structure of the app, but it is a vital one that will be important to potentially heavy users of an app like this--namely wedding photographers. An added benefit of this setup is the ability to load 35mm film in a medium format camera. You can do it in real life (with the right kind of film back) so why not in the app?
