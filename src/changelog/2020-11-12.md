I sent out [a newsletter](/newsletters/5/) last night promoting [a line of T-shirts](https://cottonbureau.com/people/trey-labs)! This has been a long time coming. I hired [a designer](https://jeanwei.com) to do a fun illustration that will hopefully have appeal beyond those interested in my app. I just think they're cool shirts. I'm hoping this will be a modest source of income towards the app being self-sustaining.
