title: Better Inventory Filtering

Previously, you were only able to filter your film inventory by format (35mm, 120) or type (black and white, color C41, color reversal E6), but not any combination of the two.

{% include components/img
    name: 'changelog/old-inventory-filters.png'
    alt: 'The old filters'
    width: 250
    height: 233
%}

Now you can quickly filter by any combination.

As is our way, the whole thing works with or without JavaScript. Here’s the only visual difference if JavaScript isn’t available:

{% include components/figure
    name: 'changelog/new-inventory-filters-without-js.png'
    alt: 'The new filters without JavaScript'
    caption: 'A “Filter” button and a page reload when you submit the form. Not as nice as if JavaScript is available, but totally&nbsp;functional.'

%}

Hooray for [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)!
