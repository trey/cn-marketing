# Why Cassette Nest?

1. I want Cassette Nest to make it easy and fun to build a **lifelong archive of metadata** about your film photography.
2. I want to **advocate for film photography**. Giving film a little bit of the metadata we enjoy by default with digital may help.
3. I want to **earn a living** by building things that I hope will make the world a little better.

So far, this little project is created by little old me, [Trey](https://twitter.com/trey). I may change the “I”s to “we”s if that changes. 🙂

If you’re taking the time to read this, I invite you to [create an account](https://app.cassettenest.com/register/)  and give me feedback via  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cassettenest)  or  [Slack](https://s.trey.cc/cn-slack).
